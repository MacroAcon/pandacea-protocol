# Aggressive Reputation Decay Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an aggressive reputation decay model for the Pandacea Protocol's Reputation.sol smart contract. The changes double the daily decay rate from 1 to 2 points per day and make the decay rate configurable by the DAO, significantly increasing the cost of maintaining a stagnant high reputation and preventing reputation farming.

## Key Changes

### 1. Smart Contract Modifications (`contracts/src/Reputation.sol`)

#### **State Variable Changes**
- **Before**: `uint256 public constant REPUTATION_DECAY_RATE = 1; // 1 point per day`
- **After**: `uint256 public reputationDecayRate; // Configurable decay rate (points per day)`

#### **Constructor Updates**
```solidity
constructor() {
    disputeCounter = 0;
    reputationDecayRate = 2; // Initialize to 2 points per day (doubled from original)
}
```

#### **New DAO Configuration Function**
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Set the reputation decay rate (only owner/DAO)
 * @param newRate New decay rate in points per day
 */
function setReputationDecayRate(uint256 newRate) external onlyOwner {
    require(newRate > 0 && newRate <= 10, "Reputation: Decay rate must be between 1 and 10");
    uint256 oldRate = reputationDecayRate;
    reputationDecayRate = newRate;
    emit ReputationDecayRateUpdated(oldRate, newRate);
}
```

#### **New Event**
```solidity
event ReputationDecayRateUpdated(uint256 oldRate, uint256 newRate);
```

#### **Updated Decay Calculation**
The `_applyDecayAndGetCurrentScore` function now uses the configurable rate:
```solidity
uint256 decayAmount = daysPassed * reputationDecayRate; // Uses configurable rate
```

### 2. Integration Test Updates (`integration/test_dispute_system.py`)

#### **New Test Functions**

**`test_automated_decay()`**
- Tests the new aggressive decay rate of 2 points per day
- Simulates 30 days passing with 60-point total decay
- Validates that reputation decay is now more aggressive

**`test_dao_can_update_decay_rate()`**
- Tests DAO's ability to update the decay rate
- Simulates changing rate from 2 to 5 points per day
- Validates that new rate is applied correctly

#### **Updated Test Suite**
The test suite now includes:
- Automated reputation decay testing
- DAO configuration testing
- Enhanced validation of decay calculations

## Economic Impact

### **Before Implementation**
- **Decay Rate**: 1 point per day
- **30-day Decay**: 30 points
- **Cost to Maintain**: Low barrier for reputation farming

### **After Implementation**
- **Decay Rate**: 2 points per day (configurable up to 10)
- **30-day Decay**: 60 points (doubled)
- **Cost to Maintain**: Significantly higher barrier

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: 30-Day Inactivity**
```
Initial Reputation: 800
Old Decay (1 point/day): 800 - 30 = 770 points
New Decay (2 points/day): 800 - 60 = 740 points
Impact: 30 additional points lost
```

#### **Scenario 2: DAO Increases Rate to 5**
```
Initial Reputation: 1000
10-day Decay (5 points/day): 1000 - 50 = 950 points
Impact: 50 points lost in just 10 days
```

## Benefits

### **1. Prevents Reputation Farming**
- Higher decay rate makes it more expensive to maintain stagnant high scores
- Forces earners to remain actively engaged in the network
- Reduces incentive for artificial reputation inflation

### **2. DAO Governance**
- Decay rate can be adjusted based on market dynamics
- Allows fine-tuning of economic parameters
- Provides flexibility for protocol evolution

### **3. Better Market Dynamics**
- Reputation scores more accurately reflect current participation
- Encourages continuous engagement rather than one-time reputation building
- Creates healthier competition among earners

### **4. Economic Security**
- Increases the cost of maintaining high reputation without activity
- Prevents collusion through reputation manipulation
- Strengthens the overall economic model

## Testing

### **Automated Tests**
```powershell
# Run all tests
.\test_aggressive_decay.ps1 -Action "all"

# Run only integration tests
.\test_aggressive_decay.ps1 -Action "test"

# Validate calculations only
.\test_aggressive_decay.ps1 -Action "validate"
```

### **Manual Validation**
The PowerShell script includes manual calculation validation:
- Tests various decay scenarios
- Validates mathematical correctness
- Ensures proper rate application

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Basic Decay Test**: 30 days with 2 points/day rate
2. **DAO Configuration Test**: Rate change from 2 to 5 points/day
3. **Edge Case Test**: Maximum decay rate of 10 points/day
4. **Boundary Test**: Reputation reaching zero

## Usage Examples

### **DAO Configuration**
```solidity
// Set decay rate to 3 points per day
reputationContract.setReputationDecayRate(3);

// Set decay rate to 5 points per day (more aggressive)
reputationContract.setReputationDecayRate(5);

// Set decay rate to 1 point per day (less aggressive)
reputationContract.setReputationDecayRate(1);
```

### **Monitoring Decay**
```solidity
// Get current decay rate
uint256 currentRate = reputationContract.reputationDecayRate();

// Get reputation with decay applied
uint256 currentReputation = reputationContract.getReputation(earnerAddress);

// Get full reputation data
(uint256 score, uint256 lastUpdated, uint256 totalDisputes, uint256 resolvedDisputes, bool isActive) = 
    reputationContract.getReputationData(earnerAddress);
```

## Security Considerations

### **Access Control**
- Only the contract owner (DAO) can update the decay rate
- Rate changes are bounded between 1 and 10 points per day
- All changes emit events for transparency

### **Rate Limits**
- Maximum decay rate of 10 points per day prevents excessive decay
- Minimum rate of 1 point per day ensures some decay always occurs
- Changes are immediately effective but bounded

### **Event Logging**
- All rate changes are logged with `ReputationDecayRateUpdated` events
- Includes both old and new rates for auditability
- Enables off-chain monitoring and analysis

## Migration Guide

### **For Existing Deployments**
1. **Deploy Updated Contract**: Deploy the new Reputation.sol with configurable decay
2. **Initialize Rate**: The constructor automatically sets rate to 2 points/day
3. **DAO Configuration**: DAO can adjust rate based on network needs
4. **Monitor Impact**: Track reputation changes and adjust as needed

### **For New Deployments**
1. **Deploy Contract**: Use the updated Reputation.sol
2. **Set Initial Rate**: Constructor sets rate to 2 points/day
3. **Configure DAO**: Transfer ownership to DAO contract
4. **Begin Operations**: Start with aggressive decay enabled

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Time-based Rate Changes**: Gradual rate adjustments over time
2. **Activity-based Decay**: Different rates for active vs. inactive earners
3. **Market-based Adjustment**: Automatic rate changes based on network metrics
4. **Tiered Decay**: Different rates for different reputation tiers

### **Monitoring and Analytics**
1. **Decay Impact Analysis**: Track how decay affects network behavior
2. **Rate Optimization**: Use data to find optimal decay rates
3. **Economic Modeling**: Simulate different rate scenarios
4. **Community Feedback**: Gather input on rate adjustments

## Conclusion

The aggressive reputation decay implementation significantly strengthens the Pandacea Protocol's economic security by:

1. **Doubling the daily decay rate** from 1 to 2 points per day
2. **Making the rate DAO-configurable** for future adjustments
3. **Preventing reputation farming** through higher maintenance costs
4. **Encouraging active participation** in the network
5. **Providing governance flexibility** for protocol evolution

This implementation completes the economic hardening phase and prepares the protocol for advanced agent-based simulations and mainnet deployment.

Integration tests for the Pandacea Builder SDK.

This test suite verifies that the Builder SDK can successfully communicate
with a live Agent Backend running in the Docker-based local development environment.

Test scenarios:
1. Happy Path: Successfully connect to a running agent and validate the structure
2. Error Path (Offline Agent): Handle timeouts or connection errors gracefully
3. Error Path (Invalid Response): Handle malformed API responses
